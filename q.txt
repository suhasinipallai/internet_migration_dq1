Problems in our dataset
For illustration purpose in the above dataset we have created each row with a problem as listed below:

1. Missing headers in the csv file
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column
3. Column data contains inconsistent unit values
4. Missing values
5. An empty row in the data
6. Duplicate records in the data
7. Non-ASCII characters
8. Column headers are values and not variable names

==========================
Missing values:
a. Deletion: Remove records with missing values
b. Dummy substitution: Replace missing values with a dummy but valid value: e.g.: 0 for numerical values.
c. Mean substitution: Replace the missing values with the mean.
d. Frequent substitution: Replace the missing values with the most frequent item.
e. Improve the data collector: Your business folk will talk to the clients and inform
 them about why it is worth fixing the problem with the data collector.

=====================
to drop duplicate values:

df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Firstname','Lastname'])

===============================

Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an
observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like
height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on
the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.
=============================================================

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
==========================================
